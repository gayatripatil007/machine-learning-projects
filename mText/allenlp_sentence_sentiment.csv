When lockdown was announced, we were asked to buy ration for the whole month and not allowed to go back outside to shops. The hostel called the vegetable vendor to come outside the hostel every week, we would each go out one-by-one and buy our vegetables. From the time the lockdown was announced till today, we are being safe. 
We are also afraid of Covid, because we have come from so far and what if something happens to us. If we do this and stay well, then we can go back to the village eventually. Nowadays, even though wardens are allowing us, none of us are really that interested to go outside for shopping, roaming around etc. Once in a week, we go outside and get vegetables and groceries. 
Only if people are sick or have a fever, they might go out to visit the doctor/to the hospital. We are following all the rules strictly till now. I am still scared, they are saying a new strain of the virus might be spreading, so we are being very careful. We go to the factory, sit at our place & do our work, and come back to the hostel, make food and then go to bed. That is all the safety we need.
