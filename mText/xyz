It has been very difficult. We were managing well before Covid, after Covid we are really struggling. Our children, who live in our native village with my mother-in-law, have not been able to go to school. With them there, and us here [in Bangalore] and not able to visit them, we are really having a difficult time.My children are not in school, they are at home only--they didn't go to school this year. They are running schools online, but we were not able to pay fees when it was due, so we did not send any of them to school this year. We try to send them for some tuitions nearby with some we know, but it is difficult. They are saying schools will open again in January 2021, we are planning to join the children back to school.
We wear masks and carry sanitiser. Shahi also gives us sanitiser when we enter and leave the factory. When we come back to the room, we wash our clothes, have a bath, use sanitiser and then cook dinner. We follow the safety precautions as much as we did in the beginning.No, we did not face any major problems because of Covid--not even financial.
